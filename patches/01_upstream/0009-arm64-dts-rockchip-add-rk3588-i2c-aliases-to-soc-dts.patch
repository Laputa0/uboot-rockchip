Subject: [PATCH 09/21] arm64: dts: rockchip: add rk3588 i2c aliases to soc
 dtsi

The i2c controllers on rk3588 are named i2c0 - i2c8. Board schematics
also use these exact numbers and we want those names to also reflect
in the OS devices because everything else would just cause confusion.
Userspace i2c access is a thing afterall.

To prevent each board repeating their list of i2c aliases, define them
in the soc dtsi, as all previous Rockchip soc do already.
